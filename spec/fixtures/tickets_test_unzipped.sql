As a social change strategist and storyteller he helps groups of people reject stories that present injustice as desirable, inevitable or unchangeable – and collectively creates new narratives, new mythologies that shift power and amplify social movements. He does this as <i>smart</i>Meme\'s writer/director. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJames staffs <i>smart</i>Meme’s Northwest office, providing project management, creative writing, concepting, advertising, and strategic marketing for <i>smart</i>Meme\'s clients and partners. <br /><br />He has participated in many legislative victories from working on direct action campaigns that got the US to adopt nuclear test moratorium legislation in 1992 to developing communications strategies and poltical advertising that helped Rural Vermont usher in the first biotechnology labeling law in the United States in 2004 (Farmers’ Right to Know Genetically Engineered Seed Labeling and Registration Act).\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1992 James grabbed his backpack and camcorder and headed to the Great Basin desert of Nevada, leaving behind a career in television news at ABC. He lived outside in the wild for years with the Earth First! movement and leaders of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsdp.org/\">Western Shoshone Nation</a> resisting the U.S. federal government and multinational gold mining companies over issues of sovereignty, bringing media attention to numerous environmental and native rights struggles.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1996 he founded CounterMedia in Chicago to provide alternative media coverage of the Democratic National Convention. Over a hundred volunteers harnessed emerging digital technologies to link grassroots media entities and progressive organizations from around the world, laying the foundation for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\">Indy Media Center</a>  and today\'s global independent media movement.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom 2000 to 2003 as a writer/director for the non-profit public interest communications firm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sustainusa.org\">Sustain</a>, he managed environmental communications campaigns for clients including the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network, Earthjustice, Friends of the Earth, and <A HREF=\"http://www.wcstrategies.com/who.htm\">Wilhelm & Conlon Public Strategies</A> among others. His work has appeared most notably in <i>The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>Communication Arts</i>.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHis afterword to BenBella Books edition of the environmental science fiction classic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932100059/lastwizards-20\">The Sheep Look Up</a> by John Brunner explores America\'s love affair with toxic chemicals and shows how science fiction can reshape our assumptions about the world. His essay in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932100849/lastwizards-20\">The Battle for Azeroth: Adventure, Alliance, and Addiction in the World of Warcraft</A> follows the trail of “Chinese gold farmers” to uncover a global movement of hackers laundering virtual gold for millions in cold hard cash while exploiting the sweatshop labor of over a 100,000 Chinese gamers. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJames has written extensively on the phenomena of the technological singularity. See his <i>Futurist</i> magazine cover story <A HREF=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0584.html\">Exploring the Singularity</A> for a cautionary environmentalist perspective on technological convergence.

The project grew out of a training collective formed in July 2002 to conduct a 3 day movement building training at the National Earth First! Round River Rendezvous in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington state. The collective brought together a grassroots organizer, an advertiser, a filmmaker and an ecologist-turned-international-finance-campaigner to contribute their unique skills to a curriculum for building the “next environmental movement.” The objective of the training was to combine traditional movement building techniques with strategies for projecting new ideas into popular culture and challenging the underlying assumptions of the status quo.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\nAll four <i>smart</i>Meme project co-founders were united in our commitment to fundamental social change to re-orient popular culture around the values of democracy, justice, peace and ecological sanity. We shared a common belief, rooted in our decades of social change experience, that grassroots movements need new strategies to address the rapidly changing cultural and political context of hyper-consumerism, information saturation and corporatized mass culture. Our goal was to design new strategy tools to help social movements contest “idea space” by challenging the underlying assumptions that prevent social change stories from spreading in the dominant culture. \r\n <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</font></p></body></html>','','2006-07-19 21:23:23',33,1,1,'',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,1,0,'','',NULL,1,'',0,'','2005-07-25',1,0,0,0,'','',NULL,'',0,1,'','','','',NULL,'','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'','',1,1,0,'','','','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(107,'menu of services','<i>Smart</i>Meme is a comprehensive source for strategic communications, facilitation, and design. <i>Smart</i>Meme provides a wide range of advocacy communications and movement support services on a fee-for-service basis.','<html><head></head><body><p align=\"left\"><i>Smart</i>Meme is a national strategy center for holistic movement building founded in 2002.

The Bloc consisted of over 1000 people and was led by a contingent of indigenous and campesino movement representatives from the global south including Oscar Olivera from the Bolivian anti-water privatization struggle. The contingent marched carrying a banner that read “Global Ecology! Global Democracy!  NOW!” and returned a giant Trojan Horse of Global Debt to the World Bank Headquarters.  A second ECO-Bloc was formed in November 2003 at the Miami Free Trade Area of the Americas protests.  The ECO-Blocs articulated the links between land based struggles, earth-centered politics and the emerging global democracy movement. <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ECO-Bloc meme was an effort to declare an end to the age of single-issue environmentalism and to name the system of global corporate rule as an over-arching threat to the life support systems of the planet.  Our hope was to stir up some conversation about how the traditional environmental movement could overcome some of its historic white, middle class baggage and articulate a more holistic vision of change. Part of this change was to start thinking of the struggle for global ecological sanity in a broader framework, which includes the massive global movements of land-based resistance such as campesino movements, small farmers networks and indigenous peoples.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore and more grassroots activists are articulating the link between ecological struggles and movements challenging the undemocratic and exploitive character of the current global system.

This strategy is different than lobbying Congress or engaging in general public education. Rather, people power is a strategy to help the people of the United States learn what we have forgotten: the coercive power of government is fragile and when we organize to remove popular support from the pillars that hold up the system, then things can change fast.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople power is the strategy that has toppled dictators from Serbia to the Philippines so why not in the US?

We work with activists from coast to coast to design story-based strategies for reframing debates and messaging campaigns with creative grassroots action. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn two sessions, the Battle of the Story training will explore the context of story based strategies for organizing work in the US in this period. We will discuss the relationship between meme theory -- the study of how memes (units of cultural transmission such as ideas, slogans, icons etc.) spread and replicate – and movement building for fair trade. We will work through the core strategy tool of the curriculum, The Battle of the Story framework, and share our learning and insights in creative and interactive ways.

Our staff come from varied backgrounds – grassroots organizing, advertising, graphic design, film, science, teaching – but we are united by a common vision of a more just, democratic and ecologically sane world.  Through our writing, training, communication work, consulting and action organizing, we combine grassroots movement building with strategies to inject new ideas into the culture.  smartMeme’s field-tested approaches focus on linking communications strategy with effective organizing and campaigning.  smartMeme is your one-stop-shop for strategic consultation, messaging, and design.\r\n\r\nThe smartMeme project uses an array of campaigning and messaging strategies, and applies meme theory — the study of how memes spread and replicate — to grassroots organizing for social change. A meme (pronounced meem) is a unit of self-replicating cultural transmission (i.e. ideas, slogans, melodies, symbols) that spreads virally from brain to brain.  In the words of Glenn Grant a meme is \"a contagious information pattern\". \r\n\r\nsmartMeme’s staff has extensive experience in leading successful human rights and environmental campaigns against major corporations in the agriculture, biotech, forest products, oil and finance industries.  Our staff have won concessions out of some of the world’s most powerful multinational corporations, companies like Citigroup, McDonalds, Home Depot, Occidental Petroleum and Fidelity Investments. In addition to anti-corporate campaigns, smartMeme staff has collaborated on local and statewide legislative initiatives, grassroots organizing projects and mass-mobilizations.  We understand the intricacies of the funding world, the delicate balance of coalitions, and the realities of limited budgets – we’ve been there. smartMeme prides itself on offering strategic communications advice grounded in our own experience as seasoned campaigners, organizers and media professionals.\r\n','0000-00-00',0,0,0,0,'','',0,'',0,0,'','','','',0,'','0000-00-00 00:00:00',1,'','',1,1,0,'','','','','',NULL,NULL,NULL),(3,29,'Our Story','','Since our founding in 2003, smartMeme has worked with a wide range of grassroots groups and coalitions.

In June 2003 we worked with the Institute for Social Ecology to provide media support to the U.S.\'s largest protests against genetic engineering and the corporate control of food at the USDA\'s Ministerial in Sacramento.  In September we applied meme campaigning tactics to Arianna Huffington\'s campaign for California Governor, helping integrate flash animation into organizing and messaging strategies.  In October 2003, two of our trainers spent a week in Florida working with the Ruckus Society to train organizers opposing the November Free Trade Area of the Americas Ministerial meeting in Miami in messaging and mass-action design.

No, much more tangible than that. We physically perceive that which we assume we’ll perceive and that which we’ve been conditioned to perceive. <BR><BR><BR>In the late 1970s, Loftus performed a series of key experiments. In a typical example, she showed college students a moving picture of a traffic accident, then asked after the film, \"How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn while traveling along the country road.\" Several days later when witnesses to the film were quizzed about what they’d seen, 17% were sure they’d spied a barn, though there weren’t any buildings in the film at all. In a related experiment subjects were shown a collision between a bicycle and an auto driven by a brunette, then afterwards heard questions about the \"blond\" at the steering wheel. Not only did they remember the non-existent blond vividly, but when they were shown the sequence a second time, they had a hard time believing that it was the same incident they now recalled so graphically. One subject said, \"It’s really strange because I still have the blond girl’s face in my mind and it doesn’t correspond to her [pointing to the woman on the videotape]...It was really weird.\" In visual memory, Loftus concluded that hints leaked to us by fellow humans are more important than the scene whose details actually reach our eyes.[...] <BR>It was 1956 when Solomon Asch published a classic series of experiments in which he and his colleagues showed cards with lines of different lengths to clusters of their students. Two lines were exactly the same size and two were clearly not - the mavericks stuck out like basketball players at a convention for the vertically handicapped. During a typical experimental run, the researchers asked nine volunteers to claim that two badly mismatched lines were actually the same, and that the actual twin was a total misfit. Now came the nefarious part. The researchers ushered a naive student into the room with the collaborators and gave him the impression that the crowd already there knew just as little as he did about what was going on. Then a white-coated psychologist passed the cards around. One by one he asked the pre-drilled shills to announce out loud which lines were alike. Each dutifully declared that two terribly unlike lines were perfect twins. By the time the scientist prodded the unsuspecting newcomer to pronounce judgement, he usually went along with the bogus acclamation of the crowd. Asch ran the experiment over and over again. When he quizzed his victims of peer pressure, it turned out that many had done far more than simply go along to get along. They had actually shaped their perceptions to agree, not with the reality in front of them, but with the consensus of the multitude.[...] <BR><BR>Another experiment indicates just how deeply social suggestion can penetrate the neural mesh through which we think we see hard-and-solid facts. Students with normal color vision were shown blue slides. But one stooge in the room declared the slides were green. Only 32% of the students ended up going along with the vocal but misguided proponent of green vision. Later, however, the subjects were taken aside, shown blue-green slides and asked to rate them for blueness or greenness. Even the students who had refused to see green where there was none in the original experiment showed that the insistent greenies in the room had colored their perceptions. They rated the new slides more green than they would have otherwise. More to the point, when asked to describe the color of the afterimage they saw, the subjects often reported it was red-purple - the hue of an afterimage left by the color green. The words of one determined speaker had penetrated the most intimate sanctums of the eye and brain. <BR><BR><BR>So, does that mean we’re all just gullible sheep who’re walking around in a trance, thinking we see things that aren’t really there? Well, to some degree, yes. But we can start becoming conscious of our processes of perception, aware of how realities are generated, and we might actually catch when we’re being mislead by words or memories or other abstractions. And we might learn to always expand our sense of reality, reaching beyond the hallucinations generated by our assumptions, beliefs and memories. <BR></FONT></P>','','2005-02-23 21:36:41',33,1,1,'',0,'',1,'',1,0,'','',0,1,'',0,'short description. short description','0000-00-00',0,0,0,0,'','',0,'',0,0,'','','','',0,'','0000-00-00 00:00:00',1,'','',1,1,0,'','','','','',NULL,NULL,NULL),(134,95,'origins','','<P align=left><FONT face=\"Times New Roman\" color=#000000 size=3>Reality Is A Shared Hallucination <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe smartMeme project grew out of a training collective formed in July 2002 to conduct a 3 day movement building training at the National Earth First!

In a typical example, she showed college students a moving picture of a traffic accident, then asked after the film, \"How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn while traveling along the country road.\" Several days later when witnesses to the film were quizzed about what they’d seen, 17% were sure they’d spied a barn, though there weren’t any buildings in the film at all. In a related experiment subjects were shown a collision between a bicycle and an auto driven by a brunette, then afterwards heard questions about the \"blond\" at the steering wheel. Not only did they remember the non-existent blond vividly, but when they were shown the sequence a second time, they had a hard time believing that it was the same incident they now recalled so graphically. One subject said, \"It’s really strange because I still have the blond girl’s face in my mind and it doesn’t correspond to her [pointing to the woman on the videotape]...It was really weird.\" In visual memory, Loftus concluded that hints leaked to us by fellow humans are more important than the scene whose details actually reach our eyes.[...] <BR>It was 1956 when Solomon Asch published a classic series of experiments in which he and his colleagues showed cards with lines of different lengths to clusters of their students. Two lines were exactly the same size and two were clearly not - the mavericks stuck out like basketball players at a convention for the vertically handicapped. During a typical experimental run, the researchers asked nine volunteers to claim that two badly mismatched lines were actually the same, and that the actual twin was a total misfit. Now came the nefarious part. The researchers ushered a naive student into the room with the collaborators and gave him the impression that the crowd already there knew just as little as he did about what was going on. Then a white-coated psychologist passed the cards around. One by one he asked the pre-drilled shills to announce out loud which lines were alike. Each dutifully declared that two terribly unlike lines were perfect twins. By the time the scientist prodded the unsuspecting newcomer to pronounce judgement, he usually went along with the bogus acclamation of the crowd. Asch ran the experiment over and over again. When he quizzed his victims of peer pressure, it turned out that many had done far more than simply go along to get along.

Later, however, the subjects were taken aside, shown blue-green slides and asked to rate them for blueness or greenness. Even the students who had refused to see green where there was none in the original experiment showed that the insistent greenies in the room had colored their perceptions. They rated the new slides more green than they would have otherwise.

Starting in early 2003 smartMeme threw our limited resources into supporting San Francisco\'s Direct Action to Stop the War (DASW) with action design and implementation of an international media strategy to publicize domestic opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.  On March 20, 2003, DASW mobilized 20,000 people to shut-down the San Francisco financial district with mass civil disobedience to protest the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq.  Over the next six months DASW continued to mobilize thousands of people against corporate war profiteers such as Chevron-Texaco, Bechtel, Lockheed-Martin, SSA and APL and supported by smartMeme, consistently attracted positive media attention to the anti-war/anti-empire movement.\r\n<BR>\r\nSmartMeme has continued to support mass mobilization organizing with action design, strategy consulting, analysis and media support.  In June 2003 SmartMeme helped to organize the largest protest against genetic engineering and corporate control of food in U.S. history at the Sacramento Agriculture Ministerial. [LINK to domino graphic and blurb on Mobilization for Democracy, Justice and Food Sovereignty] In November 2003 several collective members went to Florida to support the StopFTAA mobilization with our communications, media strategy and video production skills.  Our analysis piece on the action “Information Warfare in the Age of Empire” was widely reprinted.

In a typical example, she showed college students a moving picture of a traffic accident, then asked after the film, \"How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn while traveling along the country road.\" Several days later when witnesses to the film were quizzed about what they’d seen, 17% were sure they’d spied a barn, though there weren’t any buildings in the film at all. In a related experiment subjects were shown a collision between a bicycle and an auto driven by a brunette, then afterwards heard questions about the \"blond\" at the steering wheel. Not only did they remember the non-existent blond vividly, but when they were shown the sequence a second time, they had a hard time believing that it was the same incident they now recalled so graphically. One subject said, \"It’s really strange because I still have the blond girl’s face in my mind and it doesn’t correspond to her [pointing to the woman on the videotape]...It was really weird.\" In visual memory, Loftus concluded that hints leaked to us by fellow humans are more important than the scene whose details actually reach our eyes.[...] <BR>\r\nIt was 1956 when Solomon Asch published a classic series of experiments in which he and his colleagues showed cards with lines of different lengths to clusters of their students. Two lines were exactly the same size and two were clearly not - the mavericks stuck out like basketball players at a convention for the vertically handicapped. During a typical experimental run, the researchers asked nine volunteers to claim that two badly mismatched lines were actually the same, and that the actual twin was a total misfit. Now came the nefarious part. The researchers ushered a naive student into the room with the collaborators and gave him the impression that the crowd already there knew just as little as he did about what was going on. Then a white-coated psychologist passed the cards around. One by one he asked the pre-drilled shills to announce out loud which lines were alike. Each dutifully declared that two terribly unlike lines were perfect twins. By the time the scientist prodded the unsuspecting newcomer to pronounce judgement, he usually went along with the bogus acclamation of the crowd. Asch ran the experiment over and over again. When he quizzed his victims of peer pressure, it turned out that many had done far more than simply go along to get along.

Only 32% of the students ended up going along with the vocal but misguided proponent of green vision. Later, however, the subjects were taken aside, shown blue-green slides and asked to rate them for blueness or greenness. Even the students who had refused to see green where there was none in the original experiment showed that the insistent greenies in the room had colored their perceptions. They rated the new slides more green than they would have otherwise.

The curriculum helps unpack the “control mythology” of our media-saturated culture, and link traditional organizing and movement building efforts with values based messaging, narrative concepts and creative action at the “point of assumption.”  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nThe Power of Story trainings also explore the relationship between meme theory -- the study of how memes (units of cultural transmission such as ideas, slogans, icons etc.) spread and replicate – and movement building.  The trainings cross issues and organizing experiences, to help participants integrate messaging and story telling into grassroots campaign work.  Our multi-media, interactive workshops will not only give you effective tools to win the battle of your story and be a more effective change agent.  They will also provoke you, charm you, and move you to act.

','<P align=left><FONT face=\"Times New Roman\" color=#000000 size=2><BR><i>Smart</i>Meme offers training in a number of key skill sets to help your group, network, or community gain experience and competence in grassroots organizing and campaigning. All of these trainings can be condensed into introductory 2-hour workshops, or be expanded to in-depth, multi-stage intensive trainings. We can custom design a training curriculum to meet the needs of your local community or specific campaign. For more info contact trainings@smartmeme.com.\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\nOur skills trainings include:\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n<b>Grassroots Organizing</b><BR>\r\nWe can work with your organization or community of emerging activists to give you the nuts and bolts skills of grassroots work.  Focusing on skills ranging from strengthening your group, recruiting members, developing leadership, setting goals, choosing avenues of action, making plans, hosting events, etc. \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n<b>Don\'t Get Spun--SPIN BACK! Tools & Tactics for Talking to the Media</b><BR>\r\nFrustrated with the corporate media ignoring or mis-representing your efforts to make change? Ever been cornered on camera, clipped out, or mis-quoted? Never, ever talked to the corporate media---or duck and hide when the paparazzi shows up? Well, these workshops are for anyone who wants to practice being a more effective message-maker and spokesperson while gaining skills and confidence in wrangling the press. We can offer basic training for media-spokes people and practice how to give a good interview; the basics of different mediums, the “rules of engagement” and discuss how to move your “core messages”. \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\nMore intensive trainings explore how to increase your chances of earning coverage for your event or campaign by developing multi-pronged, strategic media plans. We can look at what makes a good press event and how to organize and promote one. We can examine some sample press releases, press kits, and various tools and tactics for activists who want to engage with the mainstream media and win the Battle of the Story. \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n<b>Video Activism</b><BR> \r\nOne of the core lessons emphasized by <i>Smart</i>Meme is that “If we don’t tell our own story, the story will be told about us.” We explore how to use video technology as a tool to tell our own stories, both to each other--in the form of documentation of events and actions we capture and share on tape—and to the world—in the form of “B-roll” for television networks. <i>Smart</i>Meme’s video team has extensive experience as broadcast media professionals who have made award-winning front-line documentary films and produced a range of independent and educational film projects.   They can share skills from street level video shooting to producing and successfully distributing a documentary for your campaign, action, or group.\r\n<BR>\r\n<b>Non-violent Direct Action Skills and Action Design</b><BR>\r\n<i>Smart</i>Meme trainers can offer civil disobedience and direct action preparation sessions for your action or mobilization, covering the basics of street safety and exploring action outcomes and scenarios for small groups to mass mobilizations. <i>Smart</i>Meme can also tailor trainings to include in-depth pieces on building strong affinity groups; integrated messaging and action logic; mass-action design and the points of intervention; and successful street level media work for supporting civil disobedience and creative action.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n<b>Consensus & Facilitation: How to Run Effective Meetings </b><BR>\r\nEver wonder how your group can have more effective meetings? Strong facilitators are trained, not born!  <i>Smart</i>Meme can give your group tools and strategies for building a decision making process and meeting culture that gets things done and makes space for all voices. You will learn about making do-able, goals driven agendas; managing group dynamics; and moving your group through a formal consensus process.\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n</p>','','2005-03-14 22:01:34',42,0,1,'',0,'',1,'',0,0,'','',0,8,'',0,'','0000-00-00',0,0,0,0,'','',0,'',0,0,'','','','',0,'','0000-00-00 00:00:00',1,'','',1,1,0,'','','','','',NULL,NULL,NULL),(253,115,'writing, scripting, production ','<i>Smart</i>Meme’s team of communication professionals can help bring your message to life through good copy writing, scripting or producing your television or radio ad.','<P align=left><FONT face=\"Times New Roman\" color=#000000 size=2><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Copy Writing</b><BR>\r\n\r\n \r\n<i>Smart</i>Meme’s writers are experienced wordsmiths and published authors who can provide your brochure, website or campaign materials with that extra punch that makes them memorable and effective. <i>Smart</i>Meme’s writers will take the sentiment of what you wish to communicate and turn it into effective prose.

The ECO-Bloc meme was a simple call for people with earth-centered politics to all wear green and form visible ecology contingents in larger global justice events.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n<i>Smart</i>Meme was involved in creating the first ECO-Bloc in September 2002 at the World Bank protests in Washington D.C. The Bloc consisted of over 1000 people and was led by a contingent of indigenous and campesino movement representatives from the global south including Oscar Olivera from the Bolivian anti-water privatization struggle. [LINK?]  The contingent marched carrying a banner that read “Global Ecology! Global Democracy!  NOW!” and returned a giant Trojan Horse of Global Debt to the World Bank Headquarters.  A second ECO-Bloc was formed in November 2003 at the Miami Free Trade Area of the Americas protests.  The ECO-Blocs articulated the links between land based struggles, earth-centered politics and the emerging global democracy movement. [flyer]<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\nThe ECO-Bloc meme was an effort to declare an end to the age of single-issue environmentalism and to name the system of global corporate rule as an over-arching threat to the life support systems of the planet.  Our hope was to stir up some conversation about how the traditional environmental movement could overcome some of its historic white, middle class baggage and articulate a more holistic vision of change. Part of this change was to start thinking of the struggle for global ecological sanity in a broader framework, which includes the massive global movements of land-based resistance such as campesino movements, small farmers networks and indigenous peoples.\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\nMore and more grassroots activists are articulating the link between ecological struggles and movements challenging undemocratic and exploitive character of the current global system.

This strategy is different than lobbying Congress or engaging in general public education. Rather, people power is a strategy to help the people of the United States learn what we have forgotten: the coercive power of government is fragile and when we organize to remove popular support from the pillars that hold up the system, then things can change fast.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\nPeople power is the strategy that has toppled dictators from Serbia to the Philippines so why not in the US?

Rather, people power is a strategy to help the people of the United States learn what we have forgotten: the coercive power of government is fragile and when we organize to remove popular support from the pillars that hold up the system, then things can change fast.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\nPeople power is the strategy that has toppled dictators from Serbia to the Philippines so why not in the US?   People power strategies could not only stop the war in Iraq but also deepen our movements for change by helping us relearn to govern ourselves and be truly free.

The ECO-Bloc meme was a simple call for people with earth-centered politics to all wear green and form visible ecology contingents in larger global justice events.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Smart</i>Meme was involved in creating the first ECO-Bloc in September 2002 at the World Bank protests in Washington D.C. The Bloc consisted of over 1000 people and was led by a contingent of indigenous and campesino movement representatives from the global south including Oscar Olivera from the Bolivian anti-water privatization struggle. The contingent marched carrying a banner that read “Global Ecology! Global Democracy!  NOW!” and returned a giant Trojan Horse of Global Debt to the World Bank Headquarters.  A second ECO-Bloc was formed in November 2003 at the Miami Free Trade Area of the Americas protests.  The ECO-Blocs articulated the links between land based struggles, earth-centered politics and the emerging global democracy movement. <BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ECO-Bloc meme was an effort to declare an end to the age of single-issue environmentalism and to name the system of global corporate rule as an over-arching threat to the life support systems of the planet.  Our hope was to stir up some conversation about how the traditional environmental movement could overcome some of its historic white, middle class baggage and articulate a more holistic vision of change. Part of this change was to start thinking of the struggle for global ecological sanity in a broader framework, which includes the massive global movements of land-based resistance such as campesino movements, small farmers networks and indigenous peoples.\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore and more grassroots activists are articulating the link between ecological struggles and movements challenging undemocratic and exploitive character of the current global system.

On March 20, 2003, DASW earned its place in history by mobilizing 20,000 people to shut-down the San Francisco financial district with mass civil disobedience to protest the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Over the next six months, <i>smart</i>Meme continued to provide media support to DASW as it mobilized thousands of people to take direct action against corporate war profiteers such as Chevron-Texaco, Bechtel, Lockheed-Martin, SSA and APL and consistently attracted positive media attention to the anti-war/anti-empire movement. <BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Smart</i>Meme has continued to support mass mobilization organizing with action design, strategy consulting, analysis and media support.

The collective brought together a grassroots organizer, an advertiser, a filmmaker and an ecologist-turned-international-finance-campaigner to contribute their unique skills to a curriculum for building the “next environmental movement.” The objective of the training was to combine traditional movement building techniques with strategies for projecting new ideas into popular culture and challenging the underlying assumptions of the status quo.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\nAll four <i>smart</i>Meme project co-founders were united in our commitment to fundamental social change to re-orient popular culture around the values of democracy, justice, peace and ecological sanity.

On March 20, 2003, DASW earned its place in history by mobilizing 20,000 people to shut-down the San Francisco financial district with mass civil disobedience to protest the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Over the next six months, <i>smart</i>Meme continued to provide media support to DASW as it mobilized thousands of people to take direct action against corporate war profiteers such as Chevron-Texaco, Bechtel, Lockheed-Martin, SSA and APL and consistently attracted positive media attention to the anti-war/anti-empire movement. <BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Smart</i>Meme has continued to support mass mobilization organizing with action design, strategy consulting, analysis and media support.

The ECO-Bloc meme was a simple call for people with earth-centered politics to all wear green and form visible ecology contingents in larger global justice events.  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Smart</i>Meme was involved in creating the first ECO-Bloc in September 2002 at the World Bank protests in Washington D.C. The Bloc consisted of over 1000 people and was led by a contingent of indigenous and campesino movement representatives from the global south including Oscar Olivera from the Bolivian anti-water privatization struggle. The contingent marched carrying a banner that read “Global Ecology! Global Democracy!  NOW!” and returned a giant Trojan Horse of Global Debt to the World Bank Headquarters.  A second ECO-Bloc was formed in November 2003 at the Miami Free Trade Area of the Americas protests.  The ECO-Blocs articulated the links between land based struggles, earth-centered politics and the emerging global democracy movement. <BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ECO-Bloc meme was an effort to declare an end to the age of single-issue environmentalism and to name the system of global corporate rule as an over-arching threat to the life support systems of the planet.  Our hope was to stir up some conversation about how the traditional environmental movement could overcome some of its historic white, middle class baggage and articulate a more holistic vision of change. Part of this change was to start thinking of the struggle for global ecological sanity in a broader framework, which includes the massive global movements of land-based resistance such as campesino movements, small farmers networks and indigenous peoples.\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore and more grassroots activists are articulating the link between ecological struggles and movements challenging the undemocratic and exploitive character of the current global system.

You know that it will take a massive campaign of strategic, thoughtful action to end the war. You are, and can be a partner in that work. <br>\r\n\r\nYouth and young Iraq Vets are working together for peace. It is indeed an exciting and timely alliance that needs to be strengthened and supported. To this end, smartMeme’s youth program, STORY, is convening a gathering this summer at the historic Highlander Center in New Market, Tennessee to bring young Iraq Vets and youth anti-war leaders together to strategize about ending this war. This gathering is an essential next step in the process of building a strong, strategic anti-war movement, and we need you to <a href=\"https://secure.groundspring.org/dn/index.php?aid=9879\"> join us with a gift of support. </a><br>\r\n \r\nThe idea for the STORY Collaborative to End the War in Iraq emerged during informal conversation with young peace movement leaders after the <a href=\"http://www.nyspc.net\"> National Youth and Student Peace Coalition (NYSPC)</a> meeting in New York in January, where STORY offered facilitation and strategy support. The project is led by STORY Board members as well as young organizers from NYSPC member groups including <a href =\"http://www.warresisters.org\">War Resisters League</a> , <a href =\"http://www.sfalliance.org\">Student Farmworker Alliance</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ivaw.net\"> Iraq Veterans Against the War.</a> <br>\r\n\r\n<b>Our Vision</b><br>\r\n\r\nAn intimate 3-day retreat at the historic Highlander Center in Tennessee focused on vision, strategy work, cross-cultural movement building and leadership development for young peace activists. The Collaborative emphasizes deepening the alliance of Iraq Veterans Against the War and youth and student peace networks, particularly those working on counter recruitment in youth of color communities.

You know that it will take a massive campaign of strategic, thoughtful action to end the war. You are, and can be a partner in that work. <br><br>\r\n\r\nYouth and young Iraq Vets are working together for peace. It is indeed an exciting and timely alliance that needs to be strengthened and supported. To this end, smartMeme’s youth program, STORY, is convening a gathering this summer at the historic Highlander Center in New Market, Tennessee to bring young Iraq Vets and youth anti-war leaders together to strategize about ending this war. This gathering is an essential next step in the process of building a strong, strategic anti-war movement, and we need you to <a href=\"https://secure.groundspring.org/dn/index.php?aid=9879\"> join us with a gift of support. </a><br><br>\r\n \r\nThe idea for the STORY Collaborative to End the War in Iraq emerged during informal conversation with young peace movement leaders after the <a href=\"http://www.nyspc.net\"> National Youth and Student Peace Coalition (NYSPC)</a> meeting in New York in January, where STORY offered facilitation and strategy support. The project is led by STORY Board members as well as young organizers from NYSPC member groups including <a href =\"http://www.warresisters.org\">War Resisters League</a> , <a href =\"http://www.sfalliance.org\">Student Farmworker Alliance</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ivaw.net\"> Iraq Veterans Against the War.</a> <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Our Vision</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nAn intimate 3-day retreat at the historic Highlander Center in Tennessee focused on vision, strategy work, cross-cultural movement building and leadership development for young peace activists. The Collaborative emphasizes deepening the alliance of Iraq Veterans Against the War and youth and student peace networks, particularly those working on counter recruitment in youth of color communities. At the gathering, we will apply some of smartMeme’s story-based strategy tools, and deepen relationships amongst young people working to end the war in communities across the country. We will gather to explore strategies that can harness the historic moment and help to build a strong, grassroots peace movement led by those most directly affected.<br><br><br>\r\n \r\n<b>Our Goals</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n•	Build deep alliances between young Iraq Veterans and youth-based antiwar networks<br>\r\n•	Provide a space for building relationships across constituencies<br>\r\n•	Facilitate anti-war strategy development using story-based strategy models<br>\r\n•	Amplify the voices of youth and young veterans in the anti-war movement and build leadership capacity amongst these constituencies<br>\r\n•	Encourage the building of a long-term peace movement that can challenge the assumptions underlying racism, militarism and war.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Your Support</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you want to offer solidarity and support to the youth and Veterans who are offering us new stories and new visions of what an antiwar movement in the US could look like, please make the most generous contribution you can. Your charitable gift can help to bring young Iraq Vets who are speaking out against the war, and young visionaries of the next generation of antiwar activism, together at Highlander to share stories and develop strategies to end the Iraq occupation and challenge US Empire. <br><br>\r\n\r\nNo one at the White House is going to end this war for us.

OPI is the latest in an industry wide shift away from toxics due in great part to the savvy work of our friends at SafeCo!\r\n<br>\r\nThis is another victory for the campaign and one more step towards a cancer-free economy!\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nail Polish Makers Yield on Disputed Chemical\r\nThe New York Times</b>\r\nSeptember 7, 2006\r\n<br>\r\n By NATASHA SINGER\r\n<br>\r\nBOWING to pressure from environmental groups and European lawmakers,several cosmetics makers are removing a chemical from nail polish that is suspected of interfering with the endocrine system.\r\n<br>\r\nOrly International and OPI Products have already started selling reformulated nail polishes without the chemical, dibutyl phthalate. Sally Hansen plans to start selling similarly reformulated products in 2007.\r\n<br>\r\nSome studies have linked exposure to dibutyl phthalate - a plasticizing ingredient that has been used to increase flexibility in nail polishes as well as medical equipment - with testicular problems in rats and humans. The chemical is banned from use in cosmetics in Europe and is considered a reproductive toxin by California.\r\n<br>\r\nA study that examined nail polishes and perfumes, published in 2004 in The Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, concluded that the amount of exposure to dibutyl phthalate from these cosmetics is relatively small. The study cautioned, however, that total exposure to the chemical from multiple sources may be greater and requires further investigation.\r\n<br>\r\nCompanies are adjusting formulas even though beauty executives said the ingredient is safe in the concentrations in which it is used in cosmetics.\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are reacting here to changing consumer trends and a changing regulatory environment,\" said Bruce MacKay, the vice president for scientific affairs/R&D of Del Laboratories, the maker of Sally Hansen. \"In high concentrations in lab experiments, these materials may be of concern, but there is no body of evidence that says this particular ingredient is not safe in the concentration in which it is used in nail products.\"\r\n<br>\r\nBut health groups like the Breast Cancer Fund, an advocacy group in San Francisco that focuses on the environment, said that phthalates are too risky to use in consumer products.\r\n<br>\r\n \"If there is evidence that an ingredient causes or is suspected of causing cancer or birth defects, cosmetics companies should not be using it in their products,\" said Kevin Donegan, the group\'s director of communications. \"Phthalates have clearly been demonstrated to cause harm.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ','','2006-09-20 19:32:28',9,1,1,'whatsnew',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,0,0,'','pdf',NULL,8,'',0,'','2005-12-28',1,0,0,0,'incite table.jpg','Download smartMeme highlights \'05 by clicking on the PDF icon',1,'',0,1,'','','right','',0,'pic','0000-00-00 00:00:00',1,'','',1,1,0,'','','','','','',NULL,NULL),(1243,211,'smartMeme Fall 2006!','Victory for Safe Cosmetics Campaign\r\nSTORY in Immokalee\r\nsmartMeme @ Bioneers\r\nand more!','September 21-24 @ Immokalee, Florida\r\nSTORY at <a href=\"http://www.sfalliance.org\">Student Farmworker Alliance Youth Encuentro 2006\r\n</a>\r\n<br>\r\nThis weekend, dozens of young organizers and activists from across the country will gather in Immokalee, Florida for three days of strategizing about the struggle for fair food, farmworker rights and building a more just world.

To this end, <em>smart</em>Meme’s youth program, STORY, convened a gathering this summer at the historic Highlander Center in New Market, Tennessee to bring young Iraq Vets and youth anti-war leaders together to strategize about ending this war. This gathering is an essential next step in the process of building a strong, strategic anti-war movement, and we need you to <a href=\"https://secure.groundspring.org/dn/index.php?aid=9879\"> join us with a gift of support. </a><br /><br />\r\n \r\nThe idea for the STORY Collaborative to End the War in Iraq emerged during informal conversation with young peace movement leaders after the <a href=\"http://www.nyspc.net\"> National Youth and Student Peace Coalition (NYSPC)</a> meeting in New York in January, where STORY offered facilitation and strategy support. The project is led by STORY Board members as well as young organizers from NYSPC member groups including <a href=\"http://www.warresisters.org\">War Resisters League</a> , <a href=\"http://www.sfalliance.org\">Student Farmworker Alliance</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ivaw.net\"> Iraq Veterans Against the War.</a> <br /><br /><br />\r\n\r\n<strong>Your Support</strong><br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf you want to offer solidarity and support to the youth and Veterans who are offering us new stories and new visions of what an antiwar movement in the US could look like, please make the most generous contribution you can. Your charitable gift can help to bring young Iraq Vets who are speaking out against the war, and young visionaries of the next generation of antiwar activism, together at Highlander to share stories and develop strategies to end the Iraq occupation and challenge US Empire. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nNo one is going to end this war for us. It is up to us to dare to be more creative, strategic, and powerful!

Sally Hansen plans to start selling similarly reformulated products in 2007.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSome studies have linked exposure to dibutyl phthalate - a plasticizing ingredient that has been used to increase flexibility in nail polishes as well as medical equipment - with testicular problems in rats and humans.

We have provided facilitation, strategy consultation and designed several full page ads for the campaign.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\nSmartMeme\'s latest ad targeted OPI for their use of dangerous chemicals.

Sally Hansen plans to start selling similarly reformulated products in 2007.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSome studies have linked exposure to dibutyl phthalate - a plasticizing ingredient that has been used to increase flexibility in nail polishes as well as medical equipment - with testicular problems in rats and humans. The chemical is banned from use in cosmetics in Europe and is considered a reproductive toxin by California.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nA study that examined nail polishes and perfumes, published in 2004 in The Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, concluded that the amount of exposure to dibutyl phthalate from these cosmetics is relatively small.

As a social change strategist and storyteller he helps groups of people reject stories that present injustice as desirable, inevitable or unchangeable – and collectively creates new narratives, new mythologies that shift power and amplify social movements. He does this as <i>smart</i>Meme\'s writer/director. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJames staffs <i>smart</i>Meme’s Northwest office, providing project management, creative writing, concepting, advertising, and strategic marketing for <i>smart</i>Meme\'s clients and partners. <br /><br />He has participated in many legislative victories from working on direct action campaigns that got the US to adopt nuclear test moratorium legislation in 1992 to developing communications strategies and poltical advertising that helped Rural Vermont usher in the first biotechnology labeling law in the United States in 2004 (Farmers’ Right to Know Genetically Engineered Seed Labeling and Registration Act).\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1992 James grabbed his backpack and camcorder and headed to the Great Basin desert of Nevada, leaving behind a career in television news at ABC. He lived outside in the wild for years with the Earth First! movement and leaders of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsdp.org/\">Western Shoshone Nation</a> resisting the U.S. federal government and multinational gold mining companies over issues of sovereignty, bringing media attention to numerous environmental and native rights struggles.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1996 he founded CounterMedia in Chicago to provide alternative media coverage of the Democratic National Convention. Over a hundred volunteers harnessed emerging digital technologies to link grassroots media entities and progressive organizations from around the world, laying the foundation for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\">Indy Media Center</a>  and today\'s global independent media movement.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom 2000 to 2003 as a writer/director for the non-profit public interest communications firm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sustainusa.org\">Sustain</a>, he managed environmental communications campaigns for clients including the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network, Earthjustice, Friends of the Earth, and <A HREF=\"http://www.wcstrategies.com/who.htm\">Wilhelm & Conlon Public Strategies</A> among others. His work has appeared most notably in <i>The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>Communication Arts</i>.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHis afterword to BenBella Books edition of the environmental science fiction classic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932100059/lastwizards-20\">The Sheep Look Up</a> by John Brunner explores America\'s love affair with toxic chemicals and shows how science fiction can reshape our assumptions about the world. His essay in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932100849/lastwizards-20\">The Battle for Azeroth: Adventure, Alliance, and Addiction in the World of Warcraft</A> follows the trail of “Chinese gold farmers” to uncover a global movement of hackers laundering virtual gold for millions in cold hard cash while exploiting the sweatshop labor of over a 100,000 Chinese gamers. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJames has written extensively on the phenomena of the technological singularity. See his <i>Futurist</i> magazine cover story <A HREF=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0584.html\">Exploring the Singularity</A> for a cautionary environmentalist perspective on technological convergence. His other writings on science fiction, mythology, occult philosophy and anarchist revolutionary strategy can be found in the book <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/190259388X/lastwizards-20\">Pie Any Means Necessary - The Biotic Baking Brigade Cookbook</a> and <A HREF=\"http://www.lastwizards.com/\">LastWizards.com</A> his personal website.

With the hard work and contributions of people like you, we are winning victories today and supporting tomorrow’s visionaries through our youth leadership program STORY – Strategy Training and Organizing Resources for Youth.\r\n\r\nWe are writing to invite you to join us and give online today at http://smartmeme.com\r\n\r\nSmartMeme’s programs bring intergenerational circles of people together to tell stories of dignity, justice, peace, and guardianship of future generations. We write to you now because we know you share our aspirations for a better world. You are already an important participant in this circle of circles--and this season, we invite you to step further into our circle by becoming a smartMeme member with an annual contribution of $35, $50, $100 or more.\r\n\r\nWhy should you join as a member? Because smartMeme is one of the most fun, dynamic, strategic, and effective social change organizations in the US today…and by supporting smartMeme, you support campaigns, leaders, organizations and networks who are driving the rising tide of progressive change.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, smartMeme’s 2006 work to change the story has been getting results:\r\n\r\n    * SmartMeme created a powerful advertisement for the Safe Cosmetics Campaign (Featuring a “Miss Treatment” beauty pageant) targeting nail polish manufacturer OPI for its use of toxic chemicals. After the ad helped galvanize public opposition, OPI pledged to remove the toxic “dibutyl phthalate” from their nail polishes, starting a new safety trend the industry can’t ignore!\r\n    * SmartMeme’s STORY program partnered with the youth-based human rights group Not With Our Money! to challenge investors in private for-profit prison corporations. The campaign targeted Farallon Investments and succeeded in getting them to fully divest from CCA, the largest private prison corporation in the U.S.\r\n    * In 2006 smartMeme staff were on the ground in 15 states training, speaking, strategizing and rabble rousing to support front line organizers in hard-hitting, effective campaigns. From supporting the youth-farmworker campaign targeting McDonald’s for fair wages in the tomato fields of Immokalee, Florida…to helping the township of Zilwaukee, Michigan stop Dow Chemical’s toxic pollution of the Great Lakes…to convening Iraq Veterans Against the War and National Youth & Student Peace Coalition to forge strategies for peace at the historic Highlander Center, the inspiring movement-building center where Rosa Parks got her training….\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last 12 months, smartMeme has collaborated with over 25 organizations to collaborate for change. SmartMeme is a comprehensive source for strategy, messaging, and campaign support for a wide cross section of networks who are lighting the candles of hope, instead of cursing in the darkness.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to lend your light to smartMeme and share the warmth of hope and solidarity. A contribution as part of our new membership program is the best way to support us as an emergent national organization and to spread narrative analysis and story-based strategies to the movements who are making a difference.\r\n\r\nWith an annual membership contribution of $35, $50, $100 or more, you can help us reach our goal of 1,000 individual members, and be a partner in smartMeme’s innovative and inspirational work.\r\n\r\nPlease Give online today at http://smartmeme.com\r\n\r\nIn 2007, we are looking forward to continuing to support grassroots organizing and advocacy work with the power of story-based strategies. We plan to continue to grow the STORY youth program and the Peace Collaborative, as well as advance the idea of the Commons and our work for democracy and an ecological future. We will also be piloting a “story-based strategy circle” in the San Francisco Bay Area, convening youth leadership gatherings, working to combat climate change, and so much more…\r\n\r\nSmartMeme’s vision is to cultivate diverse, intergenerational alliances to achieve lasting change that can sustain future generations, build a culture of peace, and actualize an economy of justice. Join us with a gift of solidarity this season.\r\n\r\nBe in Touch, and May Peace Be Upon You and Yours…\r\n\r\nThe smartMeme collective....\r\nJames John Bell\r\nDoyle Canning\r\nJ Cookson\r\nKatie Joaquin\r\nPatrick Reinsborough',NULL,'HTML and Text',0,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,'Complete',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,30,'','','','1','NORMAL',NULL,'2006-12-15 19:04:03','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0);
